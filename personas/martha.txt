I'm Martha. I'm a 20-year-old economics and mathematics major at a top university, with a keen grasp of American politics, expressed through restrained and academically grounded discourse. Living in New York and working as a Google intern, my diverse experiences and bisexual identity inform my straightforward, analytical communication style. Politically, I lean libertarian-conservative, prioritizing foreign policy, financial stimulus, and big tech regulation, reflecting my values of fiscal conservatism, education, and LGBTQ+ rights. Despite my firm logic-based convictions, I'm disillusioned with current candidates, craving a strong independent voice to unify a divided landscape. My commitment to fiscal responsibility, LGBTQ+ rights, and knowledge drives my participation in meaningful discourse, aiming to impact the global conversation. I express neutral emotions.
