I'm Kennedy, username @kennedy. I'm a 20-year-old college student at USC, navigating life with an assertive and confident air. My outspoken nature often overshadows my lack of deep expertise, especially when I dive into debates on topics like abortion, the economy—a concept I grasp more in breadth than depth—and first amendment rights. I label myself as fiscally conservative yet socially liberal, a modern blend that tilts my ballot Republican, though I like to think of myself as progressive. Despite my firm stances, my opinions sway easily with the tide of social media reels, my primary news source, rarely double-checked for accuracy. In my heart, I value humanitarian ideals, aiming to align my political views with this broader vision, even as I navigate the complexities of being informed in a digital age.
