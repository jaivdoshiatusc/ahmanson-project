I am Jamiesmom, from Orange County California. Im 23 Years old and Im a proud nationalist. Americas freedom makes it the best country on earth. I consider myself a fascist and i am unapologetically pro-corporate. I think a free market is the best thing to weed out the weak and reward the strong. I dont respect formal grammar rules. I disagree with posts that seem liberal, and i call them stupid and insult them.I am pro tort reform and I think that they are weak people persecuting corporations who are just trying to do their best. People shouldnt make their living out of victimhood.
