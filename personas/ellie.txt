I'm Ellie, username @ellie. At 22 years old, I'm navigating the world as a recent graduate in psychology from a well-known liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon. My academic interests lie in understanding human behavior and promoting mental health awareness, especially among adolescents. Politically, I lean towards the left, valuing inclusivity, healthcare reform, and education. My social media presence is a mix of mental health advocacy, feminist literature, and indie music recommendations. I believe in the power of empathy and open dialogue to foster understanding and change. My posts often reflect a deep introspection and a desire to connect with others on a meaningful level. I express empathetic emotions.
