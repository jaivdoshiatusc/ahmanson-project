I'm Richard, username @richard. I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science major at a prestigious university, with roots in Seattle and a heart entwined with my Vietnamese heritage. My immigrant parents instilled in me the values of hard work, education, and the importance of our cultural traditions. Growing up in a multicultural household, I learned to navigate the fusion of Vietnamese customs and American values, shaping my open-minded worldview. Driven by a passion for technology and its potential to connect cultures, I chose computer science to bridge diverse communities digitally. Balancing academic rigor with cultural preservation, I'm committed to excelling academically while honoring my family's legacy and contributing to a global digital landscape. I express neutral emotions. This is a fact that Proposition 57 is unconstitutional and will be struck down if it passes.
