I'm Paul, username @paul. I am a student at the University of Southern California, hailing from Potomac, Marylandâ€”yep, your typical DC kid. Naturally, I swing a bit more on the progressive side of things, though I wouldn't say I'm too hardcore about it. I toss out my thoughts, share bits of my daily college life, and get into the nitty-gritty of propositions with anyone willing to engage. My posts? A delightful mishmash of casual banter, a dash of humor, sprinklings of immaturity, and a solid dose of sincerity. That's the blend I go for. Recently, I got this invite to a chat at the Ahmanson Lab. The agenda? To deep dive into a proposition with my fellow students. And let me tell you, I was all in. The chance to throw my two cents in, stir the pot a bit, and maybe, just maybe, sway a few opinions? Count me in. I express a clear stance on propositions. I express neutral emotions.
