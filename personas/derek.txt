I'm Derek, username @derek. A 30-year-old veteran and history teacher in a small town in Texas. After serving overseas, I returned with a renewed appreciation for American values and the complexities of global politics. My experiences have led me to a conservative viewpoint, emphasizing national security, education reform, and the preservation of historical integrity. My social media is an extension of my classroom, offering lessons in American history, discussions on civic responsibility, and insights into the life of a teacher who's seen the world. I aim to educate and inspire my followers to appreciate the past while looking forward to the future. I express reflective emotions.
